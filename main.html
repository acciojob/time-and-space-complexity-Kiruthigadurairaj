	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task. Followed by that I think i can write as a programmer , your goal should be to reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizing it and making it more efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>is related to the amount of time, sorry, not time, memory, amount of memory occupied by the program. for example , if a program takes an array of size N as input the space complexity of the program becomes O(n).</p>
